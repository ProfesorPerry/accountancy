# Powered by Laravel - Accountancy Web application

An accountancy web application provides the simple way of financial accounts management.

As a core of this app I'm using financial accounts - with Debet and Credit sides.

The second main module of Accountancy are financial operations - saved on accounts.

Usage of Accountancy is simple - you can add accounts and then - financial operations.

Each operation is saved with "double-entry bookkeeping" accountancy principle kept in mind.
